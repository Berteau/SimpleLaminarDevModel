# SimpleLaminarDevModel
A simple model of the creation of laminar connectivity between eulaminate and dyslaminate cortex during the development of cortical layers.
This model is based largely on the findings in Barbas and Rempel-Clower (1997).

Requirements: VPython, PyLab

To Run: launch Cortex4ColumnAndThalamus.py
